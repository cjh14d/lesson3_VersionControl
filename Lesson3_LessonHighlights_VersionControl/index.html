            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system (VCS) refers to a system in which files are regularly backed up so that the user may restore back to a previous state. 
                            These systems make collaboration simpler and safer, and allow for the safe storage of data. There are two main types of VCS, localized and centralized.
                            Local VCSs are the most basic form of data storage. This involves manually creating, renaming, and backing up various file versions. 
                            Centralized VCSs utilize a central server that all files are saved to. The server handles versioning; this method is much easier and more reliable than local storage.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Founded February 29, 2008, Github is a online hosting service that allows users to backup and share code with collaborative partners. 
                            Although Github was designed with developers, and therefore code in mind, it can be used to save and share versions of files of any type including text documents.  
                            Github integrates with the command line based tool, Git. Github, unlike Git, features a graphical user interface instead of a command line, which allows user to browse public repositories;
                            access to private repositories are provided for additional payments. Additionally, Github features email notifications, commit history, and the ability to publish small websites.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a piece of software that was developed to assist in code development.
                            Designed with speed and data integrity in mind, versioning is saved onto the Git server. 
                            Git’s branching feature allows users to expand on an idea without necessarily keeping the idea in future versions. 
                            Although they may seem identical superficially, there is a major difference between Git and Github. While Git is a revision control system tool, Github is a service that hosts repositories and files created within Git. 
                            Git can also be integrated with cloud development services such as Cloud9, which supports hundreds of programming languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Node.js among others.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some of the most fundamental Git commands include add, commit, and push. 
                            The Git add command adds a particular file to the staging area, a metaphorical loading zone for a file.
                            Next, the Git commit command is used in order to save changes that were made since the add command.
                            Finally, Git push sends the committed files to the central server. Although these three commands are the most fundamental,
                            there are many other commands that may be used such as Git init, which creates a new local repository.
                            Git pull fetches and merges changes on the remote server with one’s local working directory.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has its’ history rooted deeply within the Linux Kernel, an operating system kernel functioning similarly to Unix.
                            Between the years 1991 and 2002, changes and patches to the Linux Kernel were distributed without the use of a version control system.
                            In 2002, Linux began distributing patches via a tool known as BitKeeper, source control management software. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, 
                            required a control system that operated efficiently and quickly. Thus, the Git program began development in 2005. Because of the program was designed to support the quite large Linux development program,
                            Git features distributed development, efficient handling of large projects, and compatibility with existing protocols.
